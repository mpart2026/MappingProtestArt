Constructed from discarded plastic debris collected from oceans and shorelines, the work assembles colorful fragments into a chaotic yet deliberate composition.

The structure was a makeshift shack built from corrugated metal, wood, and other scavenged materials, deliberately resembling informal housing found in South African townships. Placed prominently on campus, the shack functioned as both a symbol and an intervention, confronting the university community with the material realities faced by many Black and working-class students who were excluded from adequate accommodation. By inserting an informal dwelling into an elite academic space, the protest highlighted the persistence of structural inequality, spatial injustice, and the unfinished business of decolonization in post-apartheid South Africa.",Public Space,Artist Collective

Their work exposes sexism, racism, and power imbalances in the art world and broader culture, especially within museums, galleries, Hollywood, and politics.
They are best known for bold posters, billboards, and public interventions that combine statistics, sharp humor, and graphic design. Using a visual style influenced by advertising — high-contrast colors, large type, and punchy slogans — they present hard data about the underrepresentation of women and artists of color. One of their most famous posters asks: “Do women have to be naked to get into the Met. Museum?” pairing the question with a statistic about how few women artists are shown compared to how many nude female bodies appear in the collection. The collective members wear gorilla masks and adopt the names of deceased women artists to maintain anonymity. This shifts attention away from individual authorship and toward systemic critique, while also protecting members from professional backlash",Public Space,Artist Collective
